### Prerequisites

Script requires PowerShell 3.0 and higher and any modules installed you would like to use for connecting to Office 365 workloads.

### Installing

Call the script ad-hoc, or load from PowerShell profile, e.g.

Store the script in the same location as your profile; default location is
$ENV:UserProfile\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1)

Then, create a PowerShell profile when you have not done so yet:

notepad $Profile

and insert a line to load the script (making helper functions available):

& (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "Connect-Office365Services.ps1")

Next time you open PowerShell, the script should load.
